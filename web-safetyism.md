It has long been noted that in this internet age, where public discourse has
moved onto digital platforms owned and controlled by a handful of private
companies, censorship is by private companies more vigorous and constricting
than the government version. This challenge to the state-limiting ethos behind
America's Constitution was a chance for governments across the free world to
show Uncle Sam the inferiority of his ways. Instead, they are choosing to
vindicate the most paranoid rantings of gun-toting, liberty fanatics.
Increasingly capatured by rising [censorship industry][cic] and its ideology of
*web sayfetyism*, governments are starting to make censorship mandatory. And
perhaps America's fusty old constitutional order will prove to be the world's
only line of defense.

<!-- ACMA submission cockup is safetyimm at work. To what end? -->

A good eample of the trend is [Australia's Minister for
Communications](https://minister.infrastructure.gov.au/rowland) and her concern
to hold digital platforms to account for supposedly inadequate moderation of
user generated content. Ironically, but unsprisingly, her department is finding
it hard to meet the standards it expects of industry. Having called for public
submissions about a proposed [Misinformation and Disinformation
Bill][acma-call], the department has been slow releasing them, citing the need
to review the submissions  for privacy, legal compliance, and offensive
content. The first 150 submissions were released a almost month late. 

[acma-call]: https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/have-your-say/new-acma-powers-combat-misinformation-and-disinformation
[23k]: https://www.liberal.org.au/latest-news/2023/09/15/23000-submissions-comments-made-labors-misinformation-bill-government-still

It [has been reported][23k] that there are about 23,000 in total, the
department is has not provided it's own number. I can attest that least the
submission I co-authored remains unpublished.  And having made this submission
I wonder what the purpose of all that review is is. Any private information I
might reveal in my own document is my own affair, and anyone who finds the
document offensive can take it up with me. If the department feels some legal
risk from having user-generated conent on its website -- that's a hint that the
law reform should aim to reduce rather than increase risks. 

<!-- Safetyism mutes vox populi, violates known principles obscured by CI. -->

The overall effect of the safetyist urge to moderate content has been to mute
the voice of the public - a phenomenon that goes well beyond this one
administrative cockup. The safetyist ideology holds that the duty of plaftorms
not to respect their users, but to protect them. Instead of connecting users to
those users to their desired sources of information, websites are to shield
them from those souruces deemed ( (by the censorship industry) are acceptable.
to be hate speech, misinformation, disinformation or otherwise harmful.

History has seen this script before, every regime of censorship has claimed to
protect the public from harmful discourse. But no regime can have privileged,
prior knowledge of what is true and good -- it can only know and uphold
approved narratives. No one sould be fooled into thinking that censorship is
not censorship just because it is called safety. Nor should anyone forget that
it is an affront the basic workings of any liberal democracy.

Yet society *is* being fooled; these prinicples of free speech are so
well-known and time tested that it has become boring and thus lost their hold
on the minds of young people, their teachers and even of middle-managers. What
do hold their attention are the talking points of an powerful censorship
industry. A network of individuals and organizations that earn their keep by
warning of the dangers of harmful information and offering the helpful service
of telling the rest of the world what information is harmful. 

<!-- RMIT is an example of the CI. Many more  in Twitter files, etc. -->

A recent example of how this economy works is the [RMIT][rmit-fl] FactLab, a
research outfit running out of a university but also funded by by Meta
(Facebook) to fact-check social media posts. It was [suspended by
Meta][gurdn-rmit] after a an investigation by Sky News found procedural
irregulatities and a record of [fact-checks favouring one side][sky-rmit] in
Australia's upcomming Indigenous Voice referandum.

The FactLab's head Russel Skelton is an open and  well-known left-wing
partisan. This is right, everyone has the right to hold and make known their
political opinions. But few have the right to also throttle and suppress the
voices of others. Yet the ideology of web-safetyism assumes that someone such
as he must be entrusted to do just that.

<!-- Constitutions matter, but do they protect speech on private platforms?  -->


The censorship industry has a self-justifying ideology about the importance of
connecting the public to trusted source of information and protecting it from
harmful ideas. The hacks of the industry aren't obliged to pay attention to the
refutations of this ideology that had been known since the Englightenment. They
are, however, obliged to follow the law and every country has a constitutional
order underpinning it's own laws.  In the United States, a centrepiece of that
order is the first Amendment, which says:

> Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
> prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or
> of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to
> petition the government for a redress of grievances.

Under modern case law, this has become a stunningly broad limit on the powers
of government. Going far beyond the literal text, it tightly constrains the
power of any arm of any American government, whether federal, state or to
abridging the freedom of speech or the press. Although all free countries
espouse the freedom of speech, few are so willing to clip government's wings.
For example, [article 5](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gg/art_5.html) of
Germany's constitution avers that "These [free expression] rights shall find
their limits in the provisions of general laws."

But even the American courts have stopped short of applying their First
Amendment to the dealings that private entities have with each other.  There
are good reasons for this: hostess Alice is perfectly entitled to throw
Holocaust denying Bob out of her dinner party, even though Holocaust denial is
protected by the first Amendment.  Bob will just have to exercise is right
elsewhere, at least until some positive statue says otherwise; and even such
statutes will have to respec Alice's own rights of free speech and association.

All this theory becomes a very live issue when public disocurse moves onto
privately own digital platforms. Services such as a social networks and search
engines are not telephone lines; when we engage these services we want them to
filter out spam, or rank order search results.  We neither desire nor expect a
passively neutral conduit of information. Yet we can desire  an _active
neutrality_ that respects the user. Searches should rank results by relevance
to the user, and not by social desirability. If a message is filtered away as
spam, that should be because the user does not want it.

Instead, under the spell of to web safetyism, the platforms began to filter
based on what user _ought_ to want.  They chose to respect the censorship
industry more than their users. This would be one thing these platforms were
merely a handful of publishers among many. But no, they are called platforms
for a reason; they are the platforms on which modern public discourse happen.

Governments should be concerned about this fundamental threat to democracy; and
in principle this situation should have been a one-up for those constitutions
which give the governments to tackle it without America's Madisonian
hand-wringing about the speech rights of the platforms themselves. Instead
governments of democracies around the world have used their free hand to do
just the opposite. Instead of requiring companies to respect the user enough to
providing them a platforms to discuss their viewpoints freely, these countries
are instead legislating to demand that these companies comply with the
censorship industry.

The laws include Britain's Online Safety Bill and the EU's the Digital Services
Act, successor to various laws like Germany's infamous NetzDG. Among other
things, these laws require platforms to quickly block illegal content. The
Australian government is going to the next frontier of suppressing *legal*
content. 

A proposed new bill binds digital platforms to mandatory Misinformation Codes
and Standards that require them to block content defined as misinformation. The
definition of misinformation is rather vague, but the Bill makes a clear
exception for the speech of government, officially recognized media, and
educational instutions (inlcuding even those owned by foreign governments).
Like all of thse laws, Australi'as it pays lip service to balancing its
restrictions with free speech, but does so toothlessly.  Authorities are asked
politely to consider free speech in their deliberations but no actionable
limits are set on their censorship, nor are there penalties for silencing
people.

This bill carries on a common theme in such legilsation: it pushes the
decisions onto the platforms who alerady posess the discretion to block content
without having to show that it violates any law. That discretion will be
exercised under the shadow of laws which not punish them for permitting
disapproved speech and not punish them for censoring legal speech.

The Bill defines harmful speech and misinformation in vague and expansive ways.
But even when laws like this are on their foace uisng clear definitions aligned
with well-established democratic norms, the censorship would go far beyond
that. These law do not subject individual decisions to censor to any legal
procedure, instead they are left to up to risk-averse corporations who need to
stay in the good-books of a regulator.

These laws are not simply an expression of these countries own constitutional
norms. They are a dodge around those norms. Democarcies boast speech because
citizens can't be muzzled at the mere say-so of some censor. Even in
democracies with nothing like America's First Amendment, speech can only be
limited by definite laws. That's why Germany's constitution names **general**
laws (along with the protection of young persons and the right to personal
honour) as the limits on free speech.

Today's intermediated internet is far less protective than this tradition.
Posts can quietly disappear or be down-ranked without the action ever being
acknowledged, let alone justified relative to some legal standard. Governments
and the censorship industry have not been shy about taking advantage of the
opportunity to skirt their own norms. 

The American government is no exception, as is best documented in the [Twitter
Files][TRACK DOWN LINKS & REPORTERS NAMES]. This reporting from [NAME SOME
TWITTER FILE REPORTERS] which shows the elaborately organised channels through
which American security agencies gave instructions to Twitter and other
companies about what information to suppress. The censorship ranged from
stamping down on Covid [FIND LINK] heterodoxy to protecting prominent
politicians from scandalous revelations [FIND HB LAPTOP LINK]. [REREAD SOME
TWITTER-FILES REPORTAGE AND REWRITE THIS].

American courts are now being asked to rule on how deal with this apparent
violation of the first Amendment [LINK TO CASES]. Some American states have
also started to legislate against censorship by digital platforms [TEXAS HB20,
FLORIDA BILL] -- and these laws are themselves been tested in court against the
First Amendment.

But the most potent response of all has been from the market.  Free-thinking
journals like [Quillete][LINK], [UnhHerd][LINK], [....] surged in popularity
even before [Substack][LINK] supercharged the phenomenon by popularising
commercial blogging for the orthodox and heteredox alike.  [Twitter/X][LINK]
has has become a more open place since Elon Musk's quixotic takeover.
[Rumble][LINK] has become a viable for those who need an alternative to
YouTube. The list goes on.

The consensus around what narratives to support or suppress is cracking. Yet
even as voluntary private-sector censorship begins to fail, governments are
shoring it up with innovatively illiberal laws. Proponents of this
industrial-scale speech squishing would say the old norms aren't fit for the
challenges of the new age. In a world where posts go viral, it would simply be
too expensive to actually prosecute the bad guys or otherwise to be bound by
the rule of law.

Yet far for being a response to new circumstances, this innovation is a throw
back to the dawn of the printing press. Renaissance princes as found it much
easier to regulate printers than authors and much more effective to quietly
strangle publication than to risk high-profile trials.

The failure of this approach should be a warning from history. Today the
printing presses of the advanced world are remarkably free.  Whatever laws
might regulate the electronic media, it is the sacred right of the literati to
put almost any kind of [smut][LINK 50 shades of grey or better] or
[nononsense][Link to Das Kapital or better] into print. This sacred right is
the outcome of a Darwinian process where minority of societies taking this
seemingly immoderate approach included those that were long lived, prosperous,
powerful or humane enough to set the standards for the civilsed world.

Will civilisation have to re-learn this lesson the hard way? To prevent this,
people must push back against the language of online safety and harm and
reground their traditional liberal approaches. America's dynamic entrepreneurs,
stroppy governers and hair-splitting constitutional lawyers are making a good
start.  But the rest of the world should not wait for America to save itself.

Liberalism in Australia is also showing belated signs of fighting spirit. The
government's new misinformation law has not yet passed, and is looking
increasingly friendless. It has been denounced by Australia's [Human Rights
Commission][LINK], by the [Victorian Bar Association][LINK] and by [prominent
scholars][LIINK] and [Publications][LINK]. The government has also suddenly
turned shy about it's promise publish public submissions about the Bill [FILL
IN MORE DETAIL HERE]. Australian society is clearly not tamely accepting the
narrative of internet safetyism [BRING INTERNET SAFETYISM UP EARLIER AND MAKE
IT A THEME]. 

Although this draft legislation was [spawned][link] under the previous
conservative government, they have now [have come out against it][link] from
opposition. Conservatives are belatedly starting to see through the rhetoric of
web safety and observe the hostitlity of the censorship industry.

The left also needs to wise up.  That side of politics has always afraid of a
world in in which security forces can whisper in the ears of powerful censors.
And those fears are being realised, though perhaps not in the way that anyone
expected. Today [skeptics of drug companies][link], [Russia-friendly
doves][link] and even [radical feminists][link] are becoming associated with
the political right.  Left-wingers who imagine they are winning the culture war
observe that farfrom their ideas taking over the centres power, those centres
are taking over the left.

With luck liberal force on the right and left, can hold back this legislation.
But there's no need to just stay on the defensive. If there is a political will
behind "holding big tech to account", it should be used to entrench free speech
and open discourse.  Liberals can jiu-jitsu the censorship industry's efforts
and introduce legislation which guarantees neutrality, transaprency and
procedural fairness in content moderation.

This is no quixiotic demand, to its credit the EU's Digital Services Act
requires an accessible [process for dispute resultions](
https://www.dlapiper.com/en-jp/insights/publications/2023/03/dsa--a-new-era-for-online-dispute-resolution--with-an-irish-twist).
If such requirements are backed up by substantive rights to free expression and
real penalties for violating them,  they will constitute a genuine way forward
to a digital world that preserves and re-invigorates basic rights on which
liberal democracies depend.

Nobody likes their social media feed to be full of scams and vitriol, nor do
parents want their children subjected to bullying and indoctrination via their
phones.  But we can fight that without handing power to censorious,
indoctrinating bullies who treat us all like children.
