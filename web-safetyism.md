This age of internet censorship should have been the chance for the free world
to show America the inferiority of it's ways.  But, thanks to the rise of web
safetyism, governments around the world instead determined to vindicate the
most paranoid rantings of gun-toting, liberty fanatics from James Madison
onwards.  Governments are starting to make censorship mandatory, and America's
constitutional order is starting to look like the world's only line of defense.

So far in this millenium, public discourse onto digital platforms owned and
controlled by a handful of private companies. There might have been a time,
back when Twitter's then CEO Jack Dorsey was lauded for calling his company
"the free speech wing of the free speech party", that the large digital
platforms instinctively respected their users and saw their mission as
connecting those users to their desired sources of information.

But over time, these platforms drifted towards an idealogy we might call "web
safetyism" which holds that the duty of these companies is not to respect their
users but to protect them, to serve them but not when they request information
understood to be hate speech, misinformation, disinformation or otherwise
harmful.

History has seen this script before, every regime of censorship has claimed to
protect the public from harmful discourse. But no regime can have privileged,
prior knowledge of what is true and good -- it can only know and uphold the
approved narrative.  This principle is the well-known, time tested basis of
free speech; it is so well-known and time tested that it has become boring. The
managers of modern corporations, and the web-safety industry that pressures
it are not obliged to pay attention to it.

They are, however, obliged to follow the law and every country has a
constitutional order underpinning it's own laws.  In the United States, a
centrepiece of that order is the first Amendment, which says:

> Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
> prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or
> of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to
> petition the government for a redress of grievances.

Under modern case law, this becomes a stunningly broad limit on the powers of
government. Going far beyond the literal text, it tightly constrains the power
of any arm of any American government, whether federal, state or to abridging
the freedom of speech or the press. Although all free countries espouse the
freedom of speech, few are so willing to clip government's wings. For example,
[article 5](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gg/art_5.html) of Germany's
constitution avers that "These [free expression] rights shall find their limits
in the provisions of general laws."

[UNPACK THE WEB SAFETY INDUSTRY]

More recently however, the platforms have moved to respecting whatever powers
and social forces set the bounds of acceptable speech (at least as
acceptability is perceived among affluent, blue-state Americans).  This would
be fine if these platforms were merely a handful of publishers among many. But
no, they are called platforms for a reason - they are the platforms on which
modern public discourse happens and increasingly they have decided that this
discourse my only reflect one particular world v

They 
have good reasons for their reluctance. For example, if hostess Alice is
perfectly entitled to throw Holocaust denying Bob out of her dinner party, even
though Holocaust denial is protected by the first Amendment.  At least until
some positive statue says otherwise, Bob will just have to exercise is right
elsewhere; and even such statutes will have to respect with Alice's own rights
of free speech and association.




All this becomes a very live issue when we encounter censorship by digital
platforms. Services such as a social network and search engines are not
telephone lines; when we engage these services we want them to filter out spam,
or rank order search results.  We neither desire nor expect a passively neutral
conduit of information.

Yet we can desire (but increasingly cannot expect) an active neutrality that
respects the user. Searches should rank results by relevance to the user, and
not by social desirability and if a message is filtered away as spam, that
should be because the user does not want it -- not because someone decided the
user _ought_ not want it.

Of course that is not how the proponents of censorship present the matter. They
talk instead of the responsibility for platforms to combat harmful, hateful or
untrue speech.  But this argument ignores centuries of hard-won liberal
insights about how public discourse works.  Nobody has privileged, prior
knowledge of what ideas are hateful or false -- only open discourse can hash
that out. And as for harm: harmful is a as harmful does - a free society
punishes deeds, not words.

So we should not be fooled into thinking that censorship is not censorship, not
should we forget that it is an affront the basic workings of any liberal
democracy.  Governments should be concerned and even if the United States is
paralysed by hand-wringing about the speech rights of the platforms themselves,
other countries live under no such constraints.  No constitutional obstacle
prevents Australia, the EU, the United Kingdom or a host of other countries
from restricting viewpoint based censorship, or requiring procedural justice
for users who are blocked or shadow-banned.  These countries have a free hand
steal a march on old Uncle Sam.

Instead these countries have used this free hand to do just the opposite.
Instead of requiring companies to respect the user by providing them a
platforms to discuss their viewpoints freely, these countries are instead
legislating to demand that these companies uphold the elite consensus:

**The EU's the Digital Services Act** ....

**Britain's Online Safety Bill** .... [ACT?]

**Australia's proposed ACMA powers Bill** ...

Despite their differences, what these statues have in common is that they push
the work of decisions onto the platforms. There's no process to review these
decisions to ensure the blocked speech actually violated some law, these
matters are left to the discretion of the platforms. But that discretion will
be exercised under the shadow of laws which not punish for permitting
disapproved speech and not punish them for censoring legal speech.

These bills generally define harmful speech, misinformation in vague and
expansive ways. But even if they had in legally clear definitions that align
with well-established democratic norms, the censorship would go far beyond
that. These law do not subject individual decisions to censor to any legal
procedure, instead they are left to up to risk-averse corporations who need to
stay in the good-books of a regulator.

That's because these laws are a dodge around customary constitutional norms.
These countries may have America's eagerness to tie government to the mast of
the 1st Amendment. But they can still boast free speech because citizens can't
be muzzled at the mere say-so of some censor, their speech can only be limited
by definite laws.  That's why Germany's constitution names **general** laws
(along with the protection of young persons and the right to personal honour)
as the limits on free speech.

Today's intermediated internet is far less protective of expression. Posts can
quietly disappear or be down-ranked without the action ever being acknowledged,
let alone justified relative to some legal standard. This has let even the
American government in on the dodge as is best documented in the [Twitter
Files][TRACK DOWN LINK].

Reporting from [NAME SOME TWITTER FILE REPORTERS] which show the elaborately
organised channels through which American security agencies gave instructions
to Twitter and other companies about what information to suppress. The
censorship ranged from stamping down on Covid [FIND LINK] heterodoxy to
protecting prominent politicians from scandalous revelations [FIND HB LAPTOP
LINK]. [REREAD SOME TWITTER-FILES REPORTAGE AND REWRITE THIS].

American courts are now being asked to rule on how this apparent violation of
the first Amendment [LINK TO CASES]. Some American states have also started to
legislate against censorship by digital platforms [TEXAS HB20, FLORIDA BILL] --
and these laws are themselves been tested in court against the First Amendment.

But the most potent response of all has been from the market.  Free-thinking
journals like [Quillete][LINK], [UnhHerd][LINK], [....] surged in popularity
even before [Substack][LINK] supercharged the phenomenon by popularising
commercial blogging for the orthodox and heteredox alike.  [Twitter/X][rumble]
has has become a more open place since Elon Musk's quixotic takeover.
[Rumble][] has become a viable for those who need an alternative to YouTube.
The list goes on.

The consensus around what narratives to support or suppress is cracking. Yet
even as voluntary private-sector censorship begins to fail, governments are
shoring it up laws that go far beyond traditional liberal norms. Proponents of
this industrial-scale speech squishing would say the old norms aren't fit for
the challenges of the new age. In a world where posts go viral, it would simply
be too expensive to actually prosecute the bad guys or otherwise to be bound by
the rule of law.

Yet far for being a response to new circumstances, this approach is at least as
old as the printing press. Renascence princes as found it much easier to
regulate printers than authors and much more effective to quietly strangle
publication than to risk high-profile trials.

This is a warning from history, which turned out to favour the opposite, far
more liberal, approach. Today the printing presses of the advanced world are
remarkably free.  Whatever laws might regulate the electronic media, it is the
sacred right of the literati to put almost any kind of [smut][LINK 50 shades of
grey or better] or [nononsense][Link to Das Kapital or better] into print. This
sacred right is the outcome of a Darwinian process where minority of societies
t (seemingly) immoderate approach included those that were long lived,
prosperous, powerful or humane enough to set the standards for the civilsed
world.

Will civilisation have to re-learn this lesson the hard way? To prevent this.
Free societies need push back against the language of online safety and harm
and reground their traditional liberal approaches. America of is already making
a started. With it's dynamic entrepreneurs, stroppy federalism and finely
debated first Amendment jurisprudence, the US is actively fumbling around for
solutions.  It might find some.

Liberalism in Australia is also showing belated signs of fighting spirit. The
government's new misinformation law has not yet passed, and is looking
increasingly friendless. It has been denounced by Australia's [Human Rights
Commission][LINK], by the [Victorian Bar Association][LINK] and by [prominent
scholars][LIINK] and [Publications][LINK]. The government has also
suddenly turned shy about it's promise publish public submissions about the
Bill.


============
TRY TO MOVE ALL THIS UP
-------
Australian society is clearly not tamely accepting the narrative of internet
safetyism [BRING INTERNET SAFETYISM UP EARLIER AND MAKE IT A THEME]. This is
all the more remarkable because this draft legislation was [spawned][link]
under the previous conservative government.  As with Britain's conservative
government, left-wing activists have been able to use the language of safetyism
to sneak in regulations that effectively ban conservative ideas. In opposition,
Australia's conservatives have woken up to this trick, and [have come out
against the legislation][link].

[THIS IS NICE BUT NOT REALLY RELEVANT, CAN WE MOVE IT]
But it is not just conservatives who are at risk.  The left has always been
afraid of a world in in which security forces can whisper in the ears of
powerful censors. And those fears are being realised, though perhaps not in the
way that anyone expected. Today [skeptics of drug companies][link],
[Russia-friendly doves][link] and even [radical feminists][link] are becoming
associated with the political right.  Left-wingers should fear that far from
left taking over over the centres power, those centres are taking over the
left.
========


But liberals need not just stay on the defensive. If there is a political will
behind "holding big tech to account", it should be used to entrench free speech
and open discourse.  Nobody likes their social media feed to be full of hate
and vitriol, nor do parents want their children subjected to bullying and
indoctrination via their phones.  But that is no reason to allow internet
censors to become indoctrinating bullies who treat us all like children.
